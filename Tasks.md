## Notes
Understanding the structure and the flow of the application is challenging and is making me think of dropping it for a better designed one. I feel the design is part of the problem. But trying to understand it and building through it is still improving my skills at understanding design and turning them into code. So I am going to complete it. 

## Psedo code
You can add items from the item page, if no shopping list, one will be created, if there is a shopping list, item will get added to the active one, on the cart button that can increase or descrease the number of items will toggled on click.

### history
History will show all the lists created, the date created and their completion status. Clicking on a list will show the items on that list and check boxes will be added to the cart, clicking on the item will now mark the item as completed. Checking everything inside a list will set the list status as completed

### cancel and completed button
Two buttons will also be bellow the cart: cancel and completed, cancel will delete the list and completed will set the list status as completed.

### Top items
will pick the items with heighest values

### Top categories
will pick the categories with most items

### Monthly Summary
This will take a total of items bought in a month and chart it, to get data, just put in the information in the db so we can see charts for different months



### Learning
I am spending a good amount of time just thinking how do I set this up, how do I implement this, what is the best way I know to fix this and it is very nice. I go online and I read about how mostly what programmers do is think and not type like mainstream media would have you believe. And I think I am doing some of that. I would say I am spending the bulk of my time thinking. Especially on more challening projects. Once I have a process that I think can work in my find, writing the code or looking it up online is the easiest part sometimes. And it's fun. But it's also a lot of thinking.
I am doing fine. I am learning and growing and improving as a developer. It doesn't take magic to improve or hidden talent. Just daily consistent practise. And You Sadiq, You got this.

You want to be a really good developer, I know, you want to be a master of your craft. I know and understand but lose the whole exxagerated expectations. Be here, write bad code, fail and then write slightly better code, because if you dropped your expectations entirely and did just this, You will still end up as a good developer, a master of your craft.

Hell you don't become good at anything by constantly reminding yourself how bad you are at the field and all the places you have to improve. People do do that and are good but it's also exhausting and it's a golden ticket to mental issues, depression, burn out, imposter syndrome, and a whole lot.

But drop all that, and just focus on the next step, which for you is just learning how to just simply create relations between databases, figure out how to implement the most basic implementation of that and with time keep adding on it.
